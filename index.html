      <b>Machine Learning (ML) </b> is the dope new thing that everyone's talking about, because it's really good 
      at learning from data so that it can predict similar things in the future. Doing ML by hand is pretty annoying
      since it usually involves matrix math which is zero fun in JavaScript (or if you ask me: anywhere ). 
      Thankfully, <a href="https://js.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow.js</a> is here to help! It's 
      an open source library that has a lot of built-in Machine Learning-y things like models and algorithms!
    </p>
    
    <h2>Is your problem a Machine Learning problem?</h2>
    <p>Machine learning is good at classifying and labelling data. The premise of every machine learning problem is:
      <ul>
        <li>Someone gives us some data that was generated according to a <b>secret</b> formula. This data could be a bunch 
          of points (that are generated based on some math equation), but could also be fun, like images (the secret 
          formula could be "all of these dogs are golden retrievers") or sounds ("all of these sounds are made by a bird") or
        bus schedules.</li>
        <li>By looking at this data we were given, we approximate the secret formula so that we can correctly predict
          a future data point. For example, if we're given a photo, we will eventually be able to say whether it's a golden retriever or not.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
  
    <p>This is the <a href="https://js.tensorflow.org/tutorials/fit-curve.html">"fit a curve to a bunch of data"</a>
      example from the TensorFlow site: we are given a bunch of data points according to a cubic polynomial (
      i.e. generated from <code>y = a * x ^ 3 + b * x^2 + c * x + d</code>), but hasn't told us the values of these <code>a,b,c,d</code> coefficients.
      Our goal is to learn these coefficients, so that if we're given a new <code>x</code>, we can say what the <code>y</code> should be.
    </p>
    
         
    <h2 id="demo">The fun demo</h2>
    <p>
      The <b>blue</b> dots are the training points we were given. The <b>red</b> dots would be our guesses,
      based on our initial, default coefficients (hella incorrect!). Once you click the <code>train</code>
      button, the <b>green</b> dots show how our coefficients are getting better. Check what happens if we
      are given fewer data points or fewer iterations!
    </p>

    <h2>How it works</h2>
      <p>
        Most machine learning algorithms follow this pattern:
        <ol>
          <li>We have to figure out the <b>"features"</b> of the secret formula that generated the data we were given, so that we 
          can learn them. For our example, those features are the coefficients in the polynomial. For something more 
          complex like the "is this dog a golden retriever" problem, we'd have to look at pixels and colours and formations. </li>
          <li>Once we figure out these features (in our case, those <code>a,b,c,d</code> coefficients), we initialize them to some 
            random values. We could now use them to make 
          predictions, but they would be teeeeeerrible because they're just random.</li>
          <li>(I'm just going to use our actual example from now on and 
          not dogs)</li>
          <li>We start looking at every piece of <code>(x,y)</code> data point we were given. We take the <code>x</code> and based on
            these default coefficients we have created, we predict what the <code>y</code> would be. WE then look at the correct 
            <code>y</code> from the data point, calculate our error, and then adjust our coefficients so that our value would be closer
            to the actual one. This part is the most important one and TensorFlow does this for us</li>
          <li>We keep doing this for every data point we have, and repeat the entire process a bunch of iterations, and at the 
          end we've pretty much learnt the coefficients!</li>
        </ol>
